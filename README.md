# La Liga Data Analysis and Prediction

**This project focuses on analyzing historical La Liga (Spanish football league) data and player statistics to develop predictive models.**  
We use **CSV files** as input to analyze data and employ **machine learning classifiers** such as **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Decision Trees** to predict match outcomes and player performances. Data analysis and visualization are conducted using **Jupyter Notebooks**.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source**  
  Historical La Liga data stored in CSV files, including match results, team statistics, and player performances.

- **Objectives**  
  - Predict **match outcomes** (win/draw/loss).  
  - Forecast **player performance** (e.g., goals, assists).  

- **Tools Used**  
  - **Programming Language**: Python  
  - **Libraries and Frameworks**:  
    `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `Jupyter Notebook`

## Features

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Load structured data from **CSV files**.  
- Handle missing values and outliers.  
- Perform **feature engineering** to create meaningful features.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze and visualize match data distributions.  
- Generate **heatmaps**, **line charts**, and other insights.  

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- Implement multiple classifiers for predictive tasks, including:  
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  - **Decision Tree**  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- Use **cross-validation** for robust performance evaluation.  

### 4. Results Visualization
- Present **prediction outcomes** in charts.  
- Compare model performance using metrics such as **accuracy**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.
